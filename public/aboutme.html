    <h2> Who am I? </h2>
    <p> 
        
        I'm a huge tech lover who has far too many hobbies to count. 
        Learning new things and taking on new challenges despite my capabilities has always been a strong suite of mine. 
        I believe life is all about taking steps outside your comfort zone and taking a big leap of faith in trusting the process.
        The kind of hobbies I'm into are:

        <ul> 
            <li> Volleyball </li>
            <li> Reading </li>
            <li> Gaming </li>
            <li> Drawing </li>
            <li> Building Keyboards </li>
            <li> Cooking </li>
            <li> Anime </li>

        </ul>

    <h2> One thing I'm really into: </h2> 
    <p> I'm a huge fan of the Nier Automata game created by Yoko Taro, a Japanese Game Developer famous for his 
        enigmatic approach to game development. I'm also a huge fan of the soundtrack that plays throughout this masterpiece of a game.
